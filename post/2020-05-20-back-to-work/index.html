<p>It has been a bit longer than I thought. My last post ended up with the &ldquo;see you soon&rdquo; phrase&hellip; Well, that is not the &ldquo;soon&rdquo; I usually mean when saying that. Thus here is my apology to whoever could have waited for the new content.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if I could get back for a bit longer this time ;)</p>

<h1 id="what-has-happened">What has happened?</h1>

<p>Why I did stop? Well, no surprise - &ldquo;usual&rdquo; life stuff, not enough time spent with family, new job, focusing on other things&hellip;</p>

<p>Why I&rsquo;m getting back? Not yet sure. We&rsquo;re in the middle of covid-19 pandemic and it&rsquo;s somehow connected. Not that I have plenty of free time now, rather the opposite - due to its nature, my current job requires even more attention than before. It&rsquo;s rather caused by some hard times I recently went through, loss of someone close, amplified with all those changes required by the isolation. What I&rsquo;m able to realize now is that I need to focus my thoughts on something like Cinode just to keep some healthy internal balance.</p>

<p>Let the &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; begin then&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="incoming-changes">Incoming changes</h1>

<p>There are few small things I wanted to change before moving forward. Let me briefly describe those here.</p>

<h2 id="new-blog-style-and-conversion-to-hugo">New blog style and conversion to hugo</h2>

<p>I have changed the visual style of this blog, the old one was a bit rusty. I also wanted to work with something different than <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> which I used so far. Right now all is done with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>. I could&rsquo;ve been biased when choosing it by the fact that it is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">go</a>, but overall this generator turned out to be pretty powerful and lightweight. It&rsquo;s doing the job really well so far.</p>

<h2 id="new-automatic-pipeline">New automatic pipeline</h2>

<p>Source of this blog is hosted on my own private <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab</a> instance. It works as expected, builds the content of this blog and few other things (more below). The clue is that updating the content is pretty automated now - hope this will help me iterating much quicker.</p>

<h2 id="some-new-rules">Some new rules</h2>

<p>I was already working on some new content back in 2016 after my previous post was published. I tried to implement another logical step in the design/implementation of Cinode. However the implementation turned out to be rather complex. I faced multiple corner cases which forced me to rethink the solution each time, I believe to have succeeded on my third attempt if not fourth (don&rsquo;t remember now, that was loooong time ago).</p>

<p>When I finally created a working solution I was, as expected, very satisfied with it. Those algorithms seemed &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, all small tribes working correctly. But it was lacking one essential property - I didn&rsquo;t feel that all this complexity was necessary, especially at that stage of the project.</p>

<p>Now when I am able to take a step back and see the big picture I am 100% sure that I should start with a smaller step. No fancy algorithms and complex code as long as those are not needed. I should always try to find the smallest, simplest feature and implement it. That way I should be able to control the overall complexity much better. That way I should be able to avoid unnecessary robustness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve thrown away the complex machinery that was created  (and believe me, it was hard to figure out what was going on in this code after just 4 years when I tried to read it) and started looking for the next smallest thing I could make. This is how I would like to iterate moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="always-usable-proof-of-concept">Always usable proof-of-concept</h2>

<p>Every small step I am doing should be practically checked. That is why I am going to have some working software after each solved theoretical puzzle.</p>

<p>My first move will be to serve this blog through Cinode. After all, everything that makes this page compiles down to a static set of files. The generated website is not a simple html page - a bit of css, js, html here and there. Sounds like a perfect use-case.</p>

<p>Each page view of this blog through cinode will fetch multiple resources from the server. It will be easy to figure out whether the Cinode-hosted blog works fine by just looking if it renders correctly. In the next post I would like to show how it went along with some technical details of the solution.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>
